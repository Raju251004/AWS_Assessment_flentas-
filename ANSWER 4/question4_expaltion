Design and configure a basic AWS network with:
1 VPC
2 Public Subnets
2 Private Subnets
Internet Gateway (IGW) attached
NAT Gateway configured for private subnet outbound access
VPC is uesd to creat control over the virtual networking environment.
The VPC was designed using the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, which gives a large IP range and flexibility for future expansion. 
Inside this VPC I created a total of four subnets—two public and two private—to separate resources based on their access needs. 
The public subnets 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24)were created for resources that require direct internet connectivity
such as load balancers or NAT gateways. These subnets were configured with Auto-assign Public IP enabled and their route tables point to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
The private subnets 10.0.3.0/24 for development and 10.0.4.0/24 for testing were designed for internal resources that should not be publicly exposed. 
These subnets do not have direct internet access. 
Instead, their outbound traffic is routed through a NAT Gateway placed in one of the public subnets. 
This allows instances in the private subnets to download updates or access external services securely without exposing them to the internet.
The separation of development and testing environments ensures better control, security, and management of internal workloads.
